# Solis Robot - SoBot
![](imgs/SoBotArm.png)
# Introduction

AMR (autonomous mobile robotics) platform equipped with a camera system, ultrasonic and photoelectric sensors, works with a high rate of precision and repeatability of its movements, as it uses stepper motors in its movement and navigation, the SoBot also can be termed as a research and development interface, as it facilitates the practical experimentation of algorithms from the simplest to the most complex level.

This product was developed 100% by Solis Tecnologia, and has a lot of technology employing cutting-edge concepts, such as:

The motors can be controlled simultaneously or individually.
The user can select different accessories to implement to the robot.
Several programming languages can be used to connect via API.

# Programming Example
## [SMART MANIPULATION.py](_SmartManipulation.py) 
This code implements a remote control system for the SoBot, using a Logitech controller to perform functions such as movement, speed adjustment, and LED color changes. Communication with the robot is established through a serial interface, enabling the exchange of commands and real-time responses. In addition to manual control, the program integrates line sensors that allow the SoBot to autonomously follow tracks, and upon detecting ground markers, it can perform object manipulation tasks supported by computer vision.

This project uses threading to run multiple tasks in parallel (gamepad input, line sensing, and control loops). For clarity and maintainability, the logic is split across focused modules:

**Smart_Manipulation.py:** Initializes the system, starts worker threads, configures serial communication and movement parameters.

**read_gamepad.py:** Reads inputs from the Logitech controller and maps buttons/axes to robot actions: enabling/disabling motors, movement commands (forward/backward/left/right), curve modes, speed presets, and LED color changes.

**read_line.py:** Implements line-following behavior based on line sensor data. The robot adjusts its direction (left/right corrections, forward motion) to stay on track. When section points are detected by the edge sensors, object manipulation routines integrated into the vision pipeline are triggered.
